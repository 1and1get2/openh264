PREREQUISITES
- python
- nasm (for Linux, we don't currently build assembly on Mac)
- gyp (https://code.google.com/p/gyp/)


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

1. First run setup.sh to build the makefiles

./setup.sh


2. Then build:

make -C build    (to build debug)
make -C build BUILDTYPE=Release  (to build opt)


The binaries will end up in build/out/Default.

ENCODER (encode264)

To run:
encode264 <input> <output> -sw <width> -sh <height
NOTE: The encoder always pads out to 1280x720. We are working
on fixing this.


DECODER (decode264):
To run:
decode264 <input> <output>











----- Original Cisco instructions below this line -----
###### Please go to the testbin folder ######
For Cleaning existing encoder & decoder executable files:
/testbin/AutoClean_Linux.sh

For Building encoder & decoder:
/testbin/AutoBuild_Linux.sh
(Dependency: encoder needs to work with the dll of welsvp)

For Running encoder & decoder:
/testbin/CmdLineReadMe
/testbin/CmdLineExample.sh
(to linux users: please make sure the encoder/decoder files to be executable before trying to enoode/decode

###### Folder Relationship ######
testbin/: configuration files and source yuv files for instant testing
codec/:    source files for encoder and decoder
processing/:  source files for video preprocessing, the lib of welsvp is required by encoder

###### Needed by Assembly Codes ######
NASM needed to be installed: workable version 2.07 or above, nasm can be achieved at http://www.nasm.us/
